- **Web3-Native**: Purpose-built for Web3 developers with native blockchain integration
- **Sentient Economy**: Enables AI agents to participate in and coordinate across decentralized ecosystems

## Key Capabilities

- Multi-model LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Gemini)
- ReAct intelligent agent architecture with reasoning and action capabilities
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic tool discovery and execution
- Graph-based workflow orchestration system
- Web3 infrastructure integration (DID, ZKML, blockchain RPCs)
- Real-World Asset (RWA) protocol support and yield optimization
- Interactive CLI with comprehensive agent management

## Target Use Cases

- DeFi protocol interaction and analysis
- RWA yield optimization and portfolio management
- Blockchain data analysis and monitoring
- Creator economy applications
- Cross-ecosystem agent coordination
- Research and market analysis with Web3 context
