# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing and enhancing the test suite for the SpoonAI RWA (Real World Assets) yield optimization platform. The project has core functionality implemented but needs comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure reliability and maintainability of the RWA agents, tools, and services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all RWA components, so that I can confidently deploy and maintain the RWA yield optimization system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running pytest on RWA agents THEN the system SHALL execute all tests without import errors
2. WHEN testing RWA yield analysis functionality THEN the system SHALL validate agent responses and tool integrations
3. WHEN testing portfolio optimization features THEN the system SHALL verify calculation accuracy and recommendation logic
4. IF any RWA component fails testing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for the complete RWA workflow, so that I can ensure end-to-end functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing integration tests THEN the system SHALL test data flow from protocol connectors through agents to API responses
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate request/response formats and error handling
3. WHEN testing agent interactions THEN the system SHALL verify proper tool usage and LLM integration
4. IF integration tests fail THEN the system SHALL isolate the failing component and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mock implementations for external dependencies, so that tests can run reliably without external service dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use mocked protocol connectors instead of real API calls
2. WHEN testing LLM interactions THEN the system SHALL use mocked responses to ensure predictable test outcomes
3. WHEN testing data aggregation THEN the system SHALL use sample data that represents realistic protocol responses
4. IF external services are unavailable THEN tests SHALL continue to pass using mock implementations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a CLI testing interface, so that I can manually verify RWA functionality during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the CLI test script THEN the system SHALL provide interactive testing of RWA agents
2. WHEN selecting test scenarios THEN the system SHALL execute predefined test cases with sample data
3. WHEN viewing test results THEN the system SHALL display formatted output showing agent responses and performance metrics
4. IF CLI tests encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested fixes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance benchmarks for RWA operations, so that I can monitor and optimize system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure response times for yield analysis operations
2. WHEN testing portfolio optimization THEN the system SHALL track computation time and memory usage
3. WHEN benchmarking data aggregation THEN the system SHALL measure throughput for multiple protocol queries
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert developers and provide performance comparison data
